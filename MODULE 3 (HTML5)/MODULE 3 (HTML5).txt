2.How to embed audio and video in a webpage?
2.To embed audio in HTML, we use the <audio> tag. Before HTML5, audio cannot be added to web pages in the Internet Explorer era.
  To play audio, we used web plugins like Flash.After the release of HTML5, it is possible. This tag supports Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Edge in three audio formats – MP3, WAV, OGG. 
  Only Safari browser doesn’t support OGG audio format. 
  
  To embed video in HTML, we use the <video> tag. It contains one or more video sources at a time using <source> tag.
   It supports MP4, WebM, and Ogg in all modern browsers. Only Ogg video format doesn’t support in Safari browser. 
  

3.Semantic element in HTML5? 
3.A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
  Many web sites contain HTML code like: <div id="nav"> <div class="header"> <div id="footer"> to indicate navigation, header, and footer.
  In HTML there are some semantic elements that can be used to define different parts of a web page:  
  <article>
  <aside>
  <details>
  <caption>
  <figure>
  <footer>
  <header>
  <main>
  <mark>
  <nav>
  <section>
  <summary>
  <time>

4.Canvas and SVG tags
4. The HTML <svg> element is a container for SVG graphics. SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics.
   SVG can be modified through script and CSS.SVG gives better performance with smaller number of objects or larger surface.
   SVG has better scalability. So it can be printed with high quality at any resolution.

  The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics, via JavaScript. The<canvas> element is a container for graphics.
  Canvas has poor scalability. Hence it is not suitable for printing on higher resolution.
  Canvas gives better performance with smaller surface or larger number of objects.Canvas can be modified through script only
