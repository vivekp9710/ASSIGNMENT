        other objects
        such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.<br> HTML provide a means to create structured
        documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as<em><strong> headings,paragraph,lists,links,quotes
                and
                other items. </strong></em>
        HTML elements are delineated by tags written using <u>angle brackets</u>.
        tags such as &lt; img /&gt; &lt; input/&gt; directly introduce content into
        the page. Other tags such as &lt; p/&gt; surround and provide information about document text and may include
        other tags as sub-elements.
        Browser do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
