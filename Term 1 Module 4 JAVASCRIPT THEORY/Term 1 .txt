Syntax:

document.getElementById("id").classList

The add() method: It adds one or more classes.
The remove() method: It removes one or more classes.
The toggle() method: If the class does not exist it adds it and returns true. It removes the class and returns false. The second boolean argument forces the class to be added or removed.
